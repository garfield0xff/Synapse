## Gradient Descent
This Gradient Descent Code is designed for understand the speed difference between shuffle index updates and sequential index updates

## Review
1. When conducting 10 tests, the shuffle index update was faster than the sequential index update in the same epoch

2. The compile and execution speed of the program was significantly faster with SGD compared to BGD.

## Goal
- [v] linear Regression
- [v] gradient Descent
