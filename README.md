## Motivation
- Our study aims to interpret the human visual perception process as a computational process and implement it through algorithms. So We will approach the concepts fundamentally and seek to understand the pipeline process from the primary visual cortex (V1) to the fourth visual cortex (V4).


- By conducting various projects, we aim to build an understanding of computer vision algorithms, tune them, and gain diverse perspectives on these algorithms. This approach will allow us to revisit and redefine the algorithms or human cognitive processes.

## Goal
 - [ ] Single Variable LinearRegression 
 - [ ] Gradient descent
